This generally involves using all components of a \nconversational agent (speech recognition and synthesis, language understanding and generation, dialogue management) \nand integrating them into a demonstration system in some domain (e.g. providing information about a shopping mall, \ncontrolling an automated house, etc). Projects are assigned by week 3 (or earlier). Project groups contain up to 180 \npeople. Masters students have an additional element of the mark given for the quality of the literature review and \nthe level of critical analysis of the field demonstrated therein, and their understanding of the applicability of the \ntechnologies and methods used in emerging technologies and application areas.",

This is a powerpoint and/or video presentation covering the following issues, and \nthe class includes peer review of the proposed work, weighting 15%: \nWhat will your system do?Example dialogues; screen shots / mock-ups. \nWhat is the main research question / focus of the project? \nWhat components will it have? \nWhich tools / subsystems will you use? \nHow will you evaluate it? \nWhat are your different roles in the group project? \nProject plan for remaining of course. \n2.Demonstration of your working system, week towards the end of the course weighting 15% \n» This should show several dialogues in the chosen application domain, illustrating the main research issue and/or \nsystem component that is focused on. \n3.A Research Report describing the technical project in the area of Conversational Agents. This will be submitted at \ncourse end. Format is an ACL style 6-8 page conference paper, with appendices if relevant. Weighting: 55%. The \nreport should cover: \n» Main research or technical question addressed \n» Literature review / related work, including a critical analysis of the field, and commentary on applicability of \nthe technologies and methods used in emerging technologies and application areas.",
