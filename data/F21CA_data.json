        "text": "## Coursework\nThe coursework is worth 100% of the mark, and is based around a technical project, where the students have to build and evaluate\n\ntheir own end-to-end conversational agent. This generally involves using all components of a conversational agent (speech recognition\n\nand synthesis, language understanding and generation, dialogue management) and integrating them into a demonstration system in\n\nsome domain (e.g. providing information about a shopping mall, controlling an automated house, etc). Projects are assigned by week 3\n\n(or earlier). Project groups contain up to 10 people. Masters students have an additional element of the mark given for the quality of\n\nthe literature review and the level of critical analysis of the field demonstrated therein, and their understanding of the applicability of the\n\ntechnologies and methods used in emerging technologies and application areas. Each project group is expected to record minutes and\n\nagendas for each project meeting, these will be submitted as a supporting document for the final report.\n\n\nIn summary, 15% is awarded for a project presentation mid course, 15% for the project demo, and 55% for the final report in week at\n\nthe end of the course. Please see the course timetable for the week and hand in/presentation times. 15% is also given for an individual\n\nself-assessment report.\n\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n\nThere are 4 main coursework deliverables:\n\n\n1. Project presentation, mid course. This is a powerpoint and/or video presentation covering the following issues, and the class\n\n\nincludes peer review of the proposed work, weighting 15%:\n\n\nWhat will your system do?\n\nExample dialogues; screen shots / mock-ups.\n\nWhat is the main research question / focus of the project?\n\nWhat components will it have?\n\nWhich tools / subsystems will you use?\n\nHow will you evaluate it?\n\nWhat are your different roles in the group project?\n\nProject plan for remaining of course.\n\n\n2. Demonstration of your working system, week towards the end of the course weighting 15%\n\n\n1. This should show several dialogues in the chosen application domain, illustrating the main research issue and/or system\n\n\ncomponent that is focused on.\n\n\n3. A Research Report describing the technical project in the area of Conversational Agents. This will be submitted at course end.\n\n\nFormat is an ACL style 6-8 page conference paper, with appendices if relevant. Weighting: 55%. The report should cover:\n\n\n1. Main research or technical question addressed\n\n2. Literature review / related work, including a critical analysis of the field, and commentary on applicability of the technologies and\n\n\nmethods used in emerging technologies and application areas.\n\n3. Design and implementation of the system: components and architecture\n\n4. Evaluation of the system and presentation of results\n\n5. Suggestions for future work\n\n6. You will upload the record of your project meetings as a set of minutes and agendas recorded for each meeting. These minutes\n\n\nare not assessed but used to help understand project team organisation and roles. An example of this record should be\n\nformatted is here **Example Minutes Agendas.docx** **[(https://ebsglobal.instructure.com/courses/28888/files/3957440?wrap=1)](https://ebsglobal.instructure.com/courses/28888/files/3957440?wrap=1)**\n\n\n**[(https://ebsglobal.instructure.com/courses/28888/files/3957440/download?download_frd=1)](https://ebsglobal.instructure.com/courses/28888/files/3957440/download?download_frd=1)**\n\n\n4. Individual self-reflection report, weighting 15%\n\n\nA short individual report on work undertaken addressing the following questions:\n\n\n1. How did you plan and manage your own work within the group?\n\n2. To what extent did you independently solve problems and take initiative within the group?\n\n3. How did you take responsibility for your own and other’s work by contributing effectively and conscientiously to the work of your\n\n\ngroup?\n\n4. How did you actively maintain good working relationships with group members?\n\n\n5. Did you lead the direction of the group project or any aspect of it?\n\n6. Critically reflect on your roles and responsibilities within the group, and the roles and responsibilities of the other members.\n\n\n**Plagiarism statement for students:**\n\n\nThis project is assessed as group work.
